<h1>Passing Config</h1>

<p>
  There are a couple of ways to pass configuration data. One option is to expose an API endpoint that returns config,
  <strong>BUT REMEMBER</strong>, anything you pass to the client is easily visible.  Don't pass sensitive config info, such
  as private keys, connection strings, etc. 
</p>

<h2>Config from ASP.NET Core:</h2>
<pre>
{{this.appConfig | json}}
